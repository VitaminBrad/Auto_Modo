# Model-Ready Reformatting of Experimental Data  

1. Request file from a URL (presumably published expiermental data)
and do any of the following if necessary:
  1. Extract them from a zipped file, 
  2. Convert them from a excel formats (.xls, .xlsx) - needs 10 minute clean-up
2. Upload the file to OpenRefine via its API
3. Perform clean-up operations in Open Refine
4. Download the data

Future Directions:

5. Run the data on the model
6. Return model output and whether it agrees/disagrees with experiment (implicitly recommended a change in model or experiment)
7. Then either:
    1. Recommend necessary conditions for similar results or for a particular (user-defined) output to occur
    2. Allow for the observation of different model outputs with theoretically different inputs
